As a general rule, PNG files are of better quality but take more space. They also support transparency. JPEG files are preferred for most photos, unless very good quality is required.</p>      <p class="maintext"><strong>JPEG Quality:</strong> The popup and slider allow you to change the degree of        compression, on a scale from 1 to a hundred. The lower the number, the        smaller the picture but the worse the quality. Something between 60 and        80 is good for the web; 90 and more are better for printing; compressions        rate of less than 60 should not be used unless you are realy short of      place. </p>      <p class="maintext"><strong>Increase picture size if needed:</strong> This checkbox determine what Resize!        will do when it encounter a picture smaller than the desired size. If        you leave it unchecked, the picture's size will not be increased; if        you check it, it will be increase, which lowers its quality.</p>      <p class="maintext"><strong>Make names web-ready:</strong> If checked, Resize! will remove spaces and special        characters from the resized pictures' name, making them safe for uploading        on the web.</p>      <p class="maintext"><strong>DOS format:</strong> If checked, Resize! will limit the          size of the resized pictures to 8 characters plus the extension.        Needed for uploading on some old servers.</p>      <p align="center" class="maintext"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="index.html"><em>Back to the      index</em></a> </font></p>      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>      </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">      </font></p></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
