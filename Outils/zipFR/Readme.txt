Translations:
  Translated into Polish by Dawid WrÛbel. 

Corrected:
  ZeroFill now works fine with Binary, Oct and Hex Modes
  Some MP3 TAGs didn't read correctly, corrected! (Reported by Dawid WrÛbel)

Added more Options for Manual Numbering
  Remember:
  \N, is the current number given by the autonumber settings.
  \ND, is the current number in Decimal format and ZeroFill given by the autonumber settings.
  \NH, is the current number in Hexadecimal format and ZeroFill given by the autonumber settings.
  \NB, is the current number in Binary format and ZeroFill given by the autonumber settings.
  \NO, is the current number in Octal format and ZeroFill given by the autonumber settings.
  if you want to specify another ZeroFill you must write just the number after the expression
  Example: \NB12 will write the number in Binary mode and with 12 ZeroFills.
  Maximum ZeroFill alowed is 64

  Now Also, Excel Mode (A,B,C...Z, AA,AB,AC...AZ, BA,BB..BZ,AAA,AAB...AAZ)
    \NE, will write the current number in Excel Mode

  Also, Excel Mode with the chars you specify in the Manual TextBox in Autonumbering Options, 'ABCD' ...
    \NEM, will write the current number in Excel Mode with the chars from Manual in Autonumbering
    For Example, if you write in the Manual Textbox in Autonumber 'ABCD',
    and you write \NEM the program will count: A,B,C,D,AA,AB,AC,AD,BA,BB,BC...
    if you write in the Manual Textbox in Autonumber 'MNO',
    and you write \NEM the program will count: M,N,O,MM,MN,MO,NM,NN,NO,OM,ON,OO,MMM,MMN,MMO...

  Remember: The modes \NE and \NEM doesn't work with ZeroFill.

Now Support any base for numbering:
   If you write 'A' and a number or letter after the '\N' you can specify any base number, for example:
   \NA, is the current number given by the autonumber settings.
   \NA2, will write the current number in base 2 (Binary)
   \NA3, will write the current number in base 3
   \NA8, will write the current number in base 8 (Octal)
   \NA0, will write the current number in base 10 (Decimal)
   \NAA, will write the current number in base A (11) (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A)
   \NAB, will write the current number in base B (12) (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B)
   \NAC, will write the current number in base C (13) (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C)
   \NAF, will write the current number in base 16 (Hexadecimal) (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,A,B..,F,10)
   You can use values from 2 to Z, and after then you can also use the ZeroFill Value
   Example: \NA74 will write the current number in base 7 and will write 4 zeros at the left of the number.

Added More suboptions to the column's variables:
Filename
  \1, Column 1 Added 'N', to write only the Filename without extension.
  Example 1: \1 will write the filename with it's extension
  Example 2: \1N will write the filename without the extension

Size
\3, Column 3
  Added 'M' or 'K' to write the size in Megabytes or in Kilobytes.
  Added 'Z', to write the number only if the size is greater than 0
  Added ',' or '.' to format the size in miles. 
  Example 1: \3K will write the size in Kbytes.
  Example 2: \3KZ will write the size in Kbytes only if the size is greater than 0 bytes.

  Order: First you must use the chars 'M' or 'K' (Optional)
    After that you can use the char 'Z' (Optional)
    And therefore you can use ',' or '.' to format the size in thousands.

    Example with a file with size: 544209049
    Example 1: \3 will write the size of the filename: 544209049
    Example 2: \3M will write the size of the filename in Mb: 518
    Example 3: \3K will write the size of the filename in Kb: 513454
    Example 4: \3K, will write the size of the filename in Kb and formatted: 513,454
    Example 5: \3K. will write the size of the filename in Kb and formatted: 513.454
    Example 6: \3KZ, will write the size of the filename in Kb only if size is <> 0 and formatted: 513,454
    Example 7: \3Z will write the size of the filename if size <> 0, else will write nothing: 544209049

    Maximum ZeroFill alowed is 64

Columns and Dates:
  \N where N is the column number.
  if you write \1 the program will write the data item in the column 1.
  if you write \2 the program will write the data item in the column 2.
  More Specific:
  if in 'Search Text' you write 'XX' and in the 'New Text' you write '-Size \3 Ext \5-' the program will change the words XX by '-Size nnn Ext EXT-' where nnn is the file size and EXT the extension file. You can use \n for substitute by each data in any column.
  If you want to write the date text from the columns 6,7 and 8 (Creation, Modification and Accessed dates) there are this options:
  \6, \7 or \8, this will write yyymmdd (default), but if you want to be more specific then you can use:
  \6y, \6m, \6d, \6h, for write only the year, the month, the day or the time.
  Example, the modification file date (col 7) is 15 June 1972 at 12:15.
  if you write '\7d-\7m-\7y' the program will write: '15-06-1972'
  if you write '\7d\7m\7y' the program will write: '15061972'
  if you write '\7' then program will write: '19720615', by default the program will write in the format yyymmdd
  if you write '\7m-\7d, \7h' then program will write: '06-15, 1215'

MP3 Tags (only for MP3 files)
  \A = Title (default)

  \GB = Bits
  \GC = Colors (by default 256, 32K, 65K or 16M) But if you want to specify the number colors then you can use \GCC
  \GCC = Colors without format.
  Example, a 800x600x65K image, if you write '\GHx\GBBits' then program will write '600x16Bits'.

Generate a Random Name
  \R = Random name (8 characters and numbers)
  \Rn = Random name (n characters and numbers, maximum 64)
